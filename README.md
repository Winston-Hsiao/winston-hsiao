If you're a student check out Subletr a platform for short term student housing I made while in college.

### Check out www.subletr.com

A marketplace and data platform for short term housing (1-6 months) serving 800+ students at colleges around the United States. I started building it after my off-campus house burned down my sophomore year of college.
